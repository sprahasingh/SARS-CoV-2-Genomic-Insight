# SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Analysis with Deep Learning

This project focuses on the genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 (MN908947.3) using deep learning techniques. The primary goal is to analyze the virus's nucleotide composition, GC content, and functional protein sequences. It utilizes Variational Autoencoders (VAE) to cluster protein sequences and uncover structural and functional insights that can aid in the development of vaccines and therapeutic strategies.
